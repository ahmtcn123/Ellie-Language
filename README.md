# Ellie
Ellie language [NOT COMPLETE]

Why ellie? Ellie is a scripting engine that runs on embedded and sandboxed environments.

## CLI usage

`ellie ./test.ei`

Language does not have a runtime for now, here are the tasks we need to complete before creating a runtime

- Variables [X]
- Functions [X]
- If Else   [X]
- Classes   [?]
- For Loops [ ]

# Variables

```rust

v variableName : i8 = 1;
d variableName = 1; //Dynamic Variable

```

# Data Types

Ellie has same primitive types like rust

```rust
    i8
    i16
    i32
    i64
    i128
    isize
    u8
    u16
    u32
    u64
    u128
    usize
    f32
    f64
```

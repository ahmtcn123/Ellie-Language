For enhancement's you should write your idea to our message channels for approval we don't want you to waste your time if your enhancement does not fit with the project.

For bug fixes please coverup tests if you apply errors to syntax check please give a random name to [`debug_message`](https://github.com/behemehal/Ellie-Language/blob/604caa870f4ca354799c4510a1cd3e0631e2fba0/core/src/error/mod.rs#L14) field our [refactorer](./refactor.js) module will cover that error and it will index it in [`DEBUG_HEADERS.eidbg`](./DEBUG_HEADERS.eidbg). We will not approve your fix if you run refactor.js before you sent.

For security fixes please inform us about vulnerability(s) before you create public review. You can use `info@behemehal.net` mail.

Thank you

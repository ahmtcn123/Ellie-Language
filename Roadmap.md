# Roadmap

Ellie's main purpose is being embedded scripting language for everyone. Ellie's targeted audience is mainly developers who wants to use ellie as a sandbox that they can control. But as seen in [ellie.rs](./src/bin/ellie.rs) it can used as everyday programing language. Before you judge ellie please be aware ellie is a embedded scripting? language, its not intended to be [everyday programing]? language
